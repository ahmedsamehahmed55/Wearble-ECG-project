## Wearable ECG Monitoring 

System This project presents the design and implementation of a low‑power, portable ECG monitoring device built around the Arduino Nano 33 IoT. It focuses on achieving reliable real‑time telemetry while minimizing energy consumption through smart wireless management and data‑transmission optimizations. The system also explores an impedance‑measurement module for assessing electrode‑skin contact quality, paving the way for improved signal accuracy in future wearable healthcare applications.
